## So what's this all about?

It’s all about raising money for a very good cause – [Macmillan Cancer Support.](https://www.gosober.org.uk)

Macmillan provide physical, financial and emotional support to people with cancer to help them live life as fully as possible. It’s a fantastic charity and the help and support means a lot to many people.

So, for the fourth year in a row, absolute leg-end superstar Heidi is going to pass on the prosecco, say nein to the wine and just giving up any and all alcohol for a gruelling 31 days. Just to really turn things up to 11 and show us all that she’s super fucking serious, Heidi is ALSO going to be tackling the [One Hundred Pushups](https://hundredpushups.com/) fitness challenge! Her current record is one, so it's going to be quite a task! 

Also for the fourth year in a row, her mate Jonathan Scott is going to continue to be a jerk by drinking all the alcohol that Heidi is missing out on. Not only that, but he enjoys taking pictures and taunting her with it too! He goes all out to make everything as entertaining as possible so that everyone has a good laugh in the process and to help get the message out there to help raise money for a good cause.

So, check back for daily antics, beer reviews, challenges and much for from your favourite Soberhero and Not-so-Soberhero.
