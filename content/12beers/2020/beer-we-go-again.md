Well, here we are again, back between the bottle and the glue gun for a festive Drinktober special edition.

When Heidi's not engaged in alcohol free antics, she also rules over [Hull LGBT+ Community Pride, AKA Pride in Hull](https://prideinhull.co.uk) with her tiny iron fist - or something along those lines anyway! So when she mentioned raising funds for their 2021 event I jumped at the opportunity to drink beer and show off :)

So I'll hand over to her now to explain why you should be forking out all your spare cash :

> Allow us to introduce ourselves.
>
> Pride in Hull is a registered charity, run entirely by volunteers. Every penny we raise goes back to support our community.
>
> We’re here to celebrate the LGBT+ community with our friends and allies. We’re here to celebrate diverse sexualities and genders. We’re here to tell people that they are welcome in Hull. We’re here to fight for progress and acceptance.
>
> We make Pride in Hull happen because we love it and we’ve seen first-hand the effects it has on individuals and the region.
