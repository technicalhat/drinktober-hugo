For the eighth beer of Drinkmas, the Beerman brought to me : Easy Now Baby NEIPA from Bad Co. Brewing 

It's the eighth day of Drinkmas - New Beer's Eve - and I'm stretching the theme to it's limits in a flagrant case of wanting an excuse to make a costume. Baby IPA, Baby Yoda - close enough, right!

Guest starring Selwyn as the not very convincing Grogu in an undersized cardboard pod. 

Happy New Beer everyone, see you in 2021!
