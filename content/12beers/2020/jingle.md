For the fifth beer of Drinkmas, the Beerman brought to me : Jingle Bell Rock golden ale from Pennine Brewing Co.

So occasionally when people see the Beercave Christmas decorations they ask "what's with the large paper boulder with the bells glued to it?"

So I tell them : "That's the Jingle Bell Rock!"
