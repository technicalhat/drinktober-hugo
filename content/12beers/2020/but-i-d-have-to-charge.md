For the eighth beer of Drinkmas, the Beerman brought to me : Off Tempo Milkshake IPA from Bad Co. brewing

Normally this milkshake IPA would bring all the boys to the yard, but due to social distancing it's running online milkshake classes instead. 

A shiny no-prize goes to the first person to identify all the "boys" on the zoom call...
