If you've been around since the [early days](http://localhost:1313/posts/2018/day-6-a-thirst-for-justice/) you might have noticed I'm a bit of a Judge Dredd fanboy. 

So when Northern Monk released a [Thought Bubble Festival](https://www.thoughtbubblefestival.com/) collaboration beer late last year with Jock, one of my favourite Dredd artists, you can be sure I snapped up a few cans quicker than you can say "I AM THE LAW!", and couldn't resist hanging on to one to give me a chance to break out the Judge Beerman outfit again.

Drink up, creeps!
