Good news!!! I am sober and I do not fancy a drink AT ALL!! 

Bad news this is primarily due to the fact I have some sort of hideous illness, currently downing lemsip as if it’s Sauvignon Blanc and dying in bed. The cats covered in snot, I coughed so hard the Alexa asked if I was ok, and my nose is as red as a walruses nutsack. 

As I die quietly in bed, sober and poorly, remember to donate to an excellent cause and if you can’t donate, can somebody please make me some sort of soup and offer a rendition of soft kitty. - Heidi.
