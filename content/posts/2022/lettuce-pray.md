Hello and welcome to Fridays edition of #whatidowithoutthepub. What did I do without the pub? Well, er…. I went to work, had my covid and flu boosters, ate Moroccan food… nothing very exciting really! 

So let’s talk politics: specifically the Daily Star race between a wet lettuce and our recently departed PM (I’ve literally had longer drinking sessions than her term). 

I’ve always loved the lettuce 🥬 so of course, it has my backing. But what now? Is the lettuce in charge as our leader and spiritual guide? Do we say hail Caesar? 🥗 Did it vote Leaf or Romaine? 

Lettuce hope that the rest of Drinktober goes as quickly as ol’ Liz and the holy iceberg is protected at all costs.
