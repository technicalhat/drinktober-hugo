Well bloody hell, we’ve only done it!!! Not only that, we’ve only bloody smashed our fundraising target!!!!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻  
  
As ever but more so than ever this year, thank you so much to one of my dearest friends the incredible Johnny: the hard work, detail and stress you put into this challenge is unbelievable and I am so lucky to call you a best friend. You’re amazing 🍻 

And of course, thank you to everyone who has followed us, supported us and donated!!!   
  
In other less soppy news, I enjoyed today dressed like a twat as I was the only person who showed up in costume to work. So what better way to celebrate finishing this challenge and October than a movie night and a plate of bread with my tribe 💙
