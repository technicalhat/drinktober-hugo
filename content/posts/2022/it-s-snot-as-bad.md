The good news is I’m past the snot stage and onto the vomit stage! The bad news is that has left little room for comedic #whatidowithoutthepub activities, but hopefully adventures will soon resume now I can successfully roll out of bed and to the sofa. 

Today’s tipple is a feisty little cranberry juice, which is actually quite nice, with a lemsip chaser. Would be extra nice with a little vodka in there but here we all are. I’d anyone needs me I will be suitably blanketed watching horror films drinking red sober juice. - Heidi
