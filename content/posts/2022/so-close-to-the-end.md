Well that was a _WEEK_ of work being ridiculous, followed by a cheeky sickness bug which killed me off for a day or so. So Iâ€™m the spirit of catching you all up, here are the high points of my #whatidowithoutthepub week: 

* Apparently I have been at my job 15 years last week, so if anyone needs me I will be sobbing in the cupboard with my arthritis riddled hip. 
* As you can see, my Cat still enjoys his travel jacket for his adventures. 
* I am now the proud(?) owner of an 8 foot cardboard man called Alan, liberated from Burtons menswear who now resides in my office. 

  Also, now that weâ€™re so close to the end of our challenge, if youâ€™ve not donated yet DO IT NOW!! ðŸ’™
