Ordinarily I would be full of wine about now and shouting at the TV, but after a lazy napping day, all I’ve done is drink water (I’m now so hydrated I am part dolphin) and make this fantastic roast. 

Yesterday myself and the esteemed Jonathan had some fun and high jinx, with some images that will _blow your mind!_ Plans are already underway for next year….. 

Don’t forget that behind all Johnnys hard work, incredible costume wizardry and my sobriety, this is all for an excellent cause: supporting Macmillan who were very supportive in my cousins cancer victory. Please if you’re able to and enjoying our twatting about, donate if you can: every little helps!
