Alright you primitive screwheads, listen up!

This is the last post of Drinktober 2022, and to help send things off in style I've managed to recruit my awesome co-host to join me for a finale of truly epic proportions!

You might have noticed the [occasional](/posts/2020/little-goody-two-shoes/) [Evil Dead](/posts/2022/no-rest-for-the-evil/) [reference](/posts/2021/drunk-by-dawn/) creep in over the years - I rarely miss a chance to get my chainsaw out - so having finally got my hands on a can of Brew York's phenomenally named Juice Campbell vs Army of Dankness we've put together this spectacular recreation of the original movie poster.

And with that, it's all over for another year. Join us back here in 11 months' time as we attempt to turn things up yet another notch and somehow deliver an even bigger and more spectacular Drinktober 2023.

Don't forget to click the big pink button on your way out and throw a few quid in the [fundraising pot](https://www.gosober.org.uk/users/heidi-victoria-ireland) - we're only Â£20 short of the target right now and we'd love to smash on through it before the month is out!
