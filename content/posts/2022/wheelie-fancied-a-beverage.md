Today I VERY MUCH fancied a little beveragéo….. like I could have happily murdered for a small pint of wine. Still, todays #whatidowithoutthepub I decided to be productive so I cooked some  Asian food, cleaned, and did my first ever 5km on an exercise bike. 

I mean it’s not exactly a marathon but I’m wheelie pleased with myself, I’ve even supplemented cranberry juice in a wine glass. Who even am I?! 

Will I be able to walk tomorrow? Who knows. Don’t forget we’re a whole 50% through this horribly sober month, so drop a quid in the kitty if you’re able to!
