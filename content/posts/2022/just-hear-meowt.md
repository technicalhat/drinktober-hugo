Day three and I’m sat it’s not Cat-utday still. Or at least Friday night when I could enjoy a sweet, sweet vino. 

Today was a very busy day which involved much running about and not much time to miss the pub. However, now I’m home alone, this is prime drink o’clock. 

Of course, I had to distract myself and find something to fit in with #whatidowithoutthepub so I decided the only healthy thing to do was to dress up my cat. And yes, that is Louis Vuitton. Who needs a nice Gin and Tonic when you have a cat purring in a pink bomber jacket?!

Don’t  forget that if I can’t drink, you can donate! Every pound helps a great cause, and it may stop me dressing up poor Fifi.  - Heidi
