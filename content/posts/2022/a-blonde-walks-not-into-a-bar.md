I wish I could walk into a bar like, but in todays edition of #whatidowithoutthepub, I decided to take a nice leisurely long stroll to forget about how much I like wine. 

Followed by a fairly good steak dinner, I wasnâ€™t thinking about the end of October (which is a mere 15 days, 2 hours and 1 minute away) at all. Honest.
