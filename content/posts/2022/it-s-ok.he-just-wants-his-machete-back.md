After all the spookiness this week I thought a nice quiet getaway might be a good idea. Camp Crystal Lake certainly sounds like a nice relaxing place to spend a couple of days, right?

It seems like I've run into trouble with some angry locals though - I don't know what I've done wrong but this goalie is pissed about something!
