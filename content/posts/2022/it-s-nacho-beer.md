Well apparently when I’m sober I get tired like a regular person, hence I fell asleep at 9pm last night on the sofa 🤦🏼‍♀️ 

Today I am once again hopped up on water and black coffee, and #whatidowithoutthepub turns out to be work all day. However, to cheer my sober self up Let’s take a moment to appreciate my ridiculous homemade tortilla nachos which I think we can all agree are fairly impressive!! 🌮
