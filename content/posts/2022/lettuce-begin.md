After a very busy, somewhat stressful and full of flu day, ordinarily this is prime circumstances for a nice chianti and a caramel cup.

However, being a good girl observing #whatidowithoutthepub, I decided to cook a nice chicken and Caesar salad and have a vitamin water followed by a terrible film. Sadly I failed to take an appropriate photo so please enjoy the artists impression of me cooking. I also fixed the washing machine so overall sober me is a complete champ. 

Special thanks and mention to our top fan with an excellent name, Heidi Story for her donation! üíôüç∫
