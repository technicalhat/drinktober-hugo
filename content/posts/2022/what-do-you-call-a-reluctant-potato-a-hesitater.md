What do you call a reluctant potato? A hesitater.

I would likely have a small tipple after a late night at work with very little hesitation usually. However, itâ€™s still #drinktober so alternatives must be found. In todays #whatidowithoutthepub, the only solution seemed to be cooking a shed load of food. Steamed salmon, stuffed sweet potatoes the lot in fact. 

Sooner or tater I can can return to the pub, but for now this was pretty s-mash-ing! ðŸ¥” 

Remember to donate if you can to limit future potato puns, weâ€™re over halfway there and time fries when youâ€™re having fun!
