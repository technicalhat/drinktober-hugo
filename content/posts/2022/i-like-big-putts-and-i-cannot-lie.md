I do enjoy a big putt, although this gives a different meaning to clubbing. 

In today’s edition of #whatidowithoutthepub, I very much fancied some day drinking. Possibly left Over lesbian rage. However, it’s for charity innit so I decided to distract myself with my favourite competition sport, Mini Golf. 

Although it’s not as fun as drunk mini golf, I did win in a spectacular fashion and looked cute doing so, so I’ll take that. Can mini golf get me through the whole month? Will I become the next tiger woods? And what is a handicap? I’m sure we will find out! - Heidi.
