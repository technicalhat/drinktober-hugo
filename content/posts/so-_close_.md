It’s so bloody close!! 

one more day to go. I was initially not looking forward to this October, but I’ve surprisingly enjoyed it in a funny way. Covid times are weird, so getting out walking and away from boredom drinking In front of the telly has been great (Although no walking for me for a few days due to getting a massive tattoo on my foot Yesterday!) 

Overall I’m looking forward to a little drink when I finish, but I’m proud of myself. This is the year I’ve felt best about not drinking and have got out in world and explored more. This year has most definitely done me good, and hopefully it’ll carry on!
