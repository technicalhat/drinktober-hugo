I like a southern comfort or a brandy on the rocks, even a cheeky gin ting too. Yesterday I was on different rocks! 

Apparently when I don’t spend my sundays in the pub or cleaning, I enjoy outdoors now. Even getting muddy and climbing up waterfalls, j loved it! I’m even considering buying walking boots, what’s that all about? The none drinking has helped me go out and explore and actually move which I am enjoying.

I also got a surprise message over the weekend saying that this years #drinktober has helped them stop drinking themselves. That’s quite the compliment to me, had a warm fuzzy the lot. So despite the nein to wine, I’m pleased we’ve achieved something positive.
