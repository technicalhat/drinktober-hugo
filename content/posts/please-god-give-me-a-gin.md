Jesus Christ I wanted a drink tonight!! I could on practically taste it. I spent a moment gazing at the prosecco at my corner shop waving my bank card and probably looked a bit not ok. 

Frustrating day of stupid Expensive internet Dropping out and losing my work, followed by a 2 hour rowing with a smart plug which wouldnâ€™t work and I would probably kill your nan for a drink about now.
