If there's one thing we love here at Drinktober, it's shamelessly reusing the same prop twice and calling it a storyline :)

I thought I'd finally fought off the invaders, but this last one turned out to be too much for me to handle.

Now my only chance to survive is if I can Escape the Mothership!
