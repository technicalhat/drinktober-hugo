Day 2! 💪

Fiyero (AKA Mr Fifi) is enthralled by this new beer which doesnt make mother fall over.

A day of crazy pirate mini golfing was cancelled due to me a) still being sick af and b) the usual rain of the North. So instead of hitting the pub with my homies, I have scrubbed a floor, eaten lasagne with my neighbours, eaten the worlds hottest noodles (TM) and stayed off the booze!

This is my first night by my actual self (barring the cat) that I can actually remember in months, so time to have a solo sober kitchen dance party. Ive even donated 2 bottles of wine next door to avoid temptation! -HV
