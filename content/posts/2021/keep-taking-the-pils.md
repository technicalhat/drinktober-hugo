__Droogies, boozers, strumpets and losers!__ Welcome once more to the booziest charity event of the year : Drinktober!

It's been a _loooooong_ year, but we've made it this far and it's time to have some fun (well, it's time for _me_ to have some fun. Poor Heidi gets to spend a month on the wagon while I muck about and have a laugh.) 

This year we're going even bigger and even better, with more beers, sillier antics, and a bumper crop of poor-quality cosplay, so watch this space and get ready to chuck some cash in the pot and make all this nonsense worthwhile!
