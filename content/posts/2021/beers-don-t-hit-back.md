And we're off! Welcome back to another month of the booze-inspired mayhem known as Drinktober. We've got some absolutely phenomenal stuff coming up this year so get ready to go hammer on that donate button!

Kicking things off with a kung fu classic as I whip out my trusty beer-chucks and prepare to Enter the Dragon!
