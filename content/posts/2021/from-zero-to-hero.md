Look at that _artistic_ photo! The colour, the style, the _Asthetic!_ 📸 

Some of you might know this has been a bit of a mad year for me, certainly not one I was expecting, and one I have certainly hit the bar amongst other things pretty bloody hard. So this year will probably be my biggest challenge yet. 

Kicking it off today is this flirty little Heineken 0.0 delight, served with a bloody amazing steak sandwich at my favourite establishment The Punch Hotel. The bar staff nearly fell off their chair when I ordered it. 

Considering I’m currently dying of the chest infection and sore throat from hell I’m not struggling yet, although let’s see how long that continues……. 🍺 ✋
