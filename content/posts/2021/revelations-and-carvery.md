Another day, more water and Heineken Zero! I also appear to have replaced vino with food considering the amount of carvery I’ve put away today. 

I've had a weekend of sleep, reading and revelations being by myself and sober. Some of my closer people know this has been a bit of a mad year for me with a lot of anxiety and change, but apparently it appears that I actually quite enjoy being by myself and I don’t need anyone to meet my needs or look after me. I would have enjoyed this revelation with a nice Chablis or Sauvignon, but still: personal growth!
