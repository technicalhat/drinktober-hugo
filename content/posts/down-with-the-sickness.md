I am down with the sickness, like the disturbed sang. 

Sadly, considering I fell asleep last night and woke up at 4.30 pm today (and I’m still in bed dying now), I don’t have any comedic #whatidowithoutthepub adventures to share, because I’ve just been sleeping and sick! On the plus I’ve caught up on some reading and some crap bed TV, and I’m far too ill to go to the off license or open the door to londis delivery, so I am still very much sober. 

I’ve heard donation to Macmillan cancer charity helps starve off flu bugs, so don’t forget to send a quid to our cause if you’d like me to survive! -Heidi
