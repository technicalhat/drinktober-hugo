We've reached once again, the final night of [#Drinktober](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/drinktober?epa=HASHTAG) -Drinkowe'en is here! Seemed only right to see the end with the most evil beer I could lay my hands on...

If you've enjoyed my ridiculous antics all month, why not click on the link over there -> (or down below if you're on mobile) and donate a few bob for the real hero of Drinktober. 

Poor Heidi's not had a drink or a sausage all month, so get your hands in your pockets and make it all worth while!
