For the 4th of Drinktober we step into the ring with the mighty El Loco - the most feared luchador in all of East Yorkshire!

Undefeated in every match, this fearsome hero of the ring strikes terror into the hearts of his opponents, and loves nothing more than to celebrate a successful match with a victory beer!
