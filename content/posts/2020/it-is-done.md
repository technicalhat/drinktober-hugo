IT 👏 IS 👏 DONE 👏

I waited until 12 to have a prosecco.....but after 2 glasses I’m done, I don’t even want to get lashed!   
Possibly the weirdest DrinkTober yet, with covid and a new lockdown as of today, but I’m actually feeling quite good. This is the year I’ve actually enjoyed the break and felt more comfortable to not drink. Im proud of myself and feeling quite grown up. 

Every year without fail, I feel blessed af and humble to have friends like Johnny and vikki who put so much effort in for me: this years been a ballache for me with various house issues, family is hospital, work nightmares and illness, but they’ve perseveres and made this a success. Mates like that are better than a box of wine anyway. 

See y’all Next year! 💙
