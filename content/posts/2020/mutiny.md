Gather round and listen to this tale of treachery upon the high seas. 

It seems my shipmates took offence to my language yesterday, in the middle of the night those mutinous dogs dragged me from my bunk and tossed me overboard.

I managed to save myself from Davey Jones' locker by lashing a raft together from some driftwood, but now I'm a castaway, adrift upon the Big Sea.
