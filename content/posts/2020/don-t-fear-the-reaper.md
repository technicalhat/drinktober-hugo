And so at last we come to the final night of Drinktober 2020. It's Drinkowe'en - the drunkest, spookiest night of the year!

I hope you've enjoyed my ridiculous antics all month - we're still a long way from the target so if you've been thinking about making a donation now's the time to hit that link over there, right under Heidi.

As for me, I'm going to enjoy a nice quiet drink outdoors - in the _Garden of Death!_
