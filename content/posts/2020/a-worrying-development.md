Today’s the first day I fancied a drink, which had led to a somewhat worrying development. 

To keep me occupied, I have now replaced having a relaxing glass of wine with DIY. Today we have had a light fitted, ripped down a ceiling and it’s now 11pm and I’m removing all the grout from the bathroom tiles. 

Is this healthy? Where will this end? 

Will we survive?!!!! 

Also my feet hurt, my hand is black And I have a significant amount of plaster in my hair and tit region.
