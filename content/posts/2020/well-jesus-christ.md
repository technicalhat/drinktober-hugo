Well, that was a few days. Sent to work from home because I’ve developed a bizarre hives like rash type affair _EVERYWHERE_..... which apparently is a covid sign. Also, I’ve developed random sporadic vomiting today, WITHOUT EVEN HAVING AN ALCOHOL. Wtf?!! 

So I am currently very itchy, a bit nauseous, and with a headache from 11 and a half hours on zoom meeting, and a little drink would be bloody fantastic. 

Over and out. Jesus Christ.
