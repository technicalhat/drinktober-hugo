Ok day three, whatcha got? 

Well we all know I’m a prolific stress drinker. So today I had a small paddy that my house is essentially falling down, nothing works and my pipes (Which are leaking) are made of lead (apparently this is bad). So I realllllly fancied some wine, or 9 double vodkas of something . 

However, I’ve stayed strong and drank water all goddamn day. Which is slightly less appealing to drink when it’s slowly dripping from your ceiling.
