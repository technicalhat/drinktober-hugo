So, that's about it for Drinktober 2020 then. I don't know about you guys, but I've had a lot of fun. I'm already starting to plot next year's antics, I'm going to have to pull out quite a few stops if I want to top this one!

As always, the donation site will be open for a while yet, so if you've been meaning to chuck something in the pot and haven't got around to it yet there's still time.

See you next year - assuming there is one!
