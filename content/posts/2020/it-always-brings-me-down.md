Tonight sees me back in the lab and testing out my latest invention - this handy, compact anti-gravity machine, which is definitely a brand new invention and not the [dream machine](https://drinktober.co.uk/posts/2020/sweet-dreams-are-made-of-beer/ "dream machine") with a new label hastily taped to the front!

As you can see, things got away from me during the first test - my beer drifted away, torn from my hands by the _Wild Gravity!_

It's true what they say- gravity is a harsh mistress!
