I’ve survived a challenge! 

Most of you people know I’m a little..... funny. I’m quite OCD and if things aren’t right or tidy, expect a breakdown. I’m also an emotional drinker: annoyed? Have a brandy. Happy? Have a champers. Stressed? Vat of wine and an absolut chaser. 

So yesterday I didn’t manage a post, but I did have half my kitchen ceiling down fixing a leaking lead pipe, plaster all over, half my bathroom taken out and no electric due to my dodge lighting. And I didn’t even have a drink! Fair play I did have a slight chinese, but not a drop of alcohol 🍸 No meltdowns, no stress, no booze. Despite still not having any lighting in my house. Chuffed with that!
