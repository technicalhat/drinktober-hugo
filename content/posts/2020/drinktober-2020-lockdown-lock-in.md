Welcome back to Drinktober 2020 - we're having a lock-in! Or a lockdown! Hopefully not getting locked up...

I'm not the type to let a little thing like a global pandemic, or impending political and economic collapse get in the way of a good time, so Drinktober 2020 is going ahead as scheduled.

I've got an exciting range of beers lined up thanks to the excellent chaps at [Beer Bandits](https://www.beerbandits.co.uk/), conveniently located just down the road from me, and lots of extremely silly antics planned, so watch this space and ready your wallets for the biggest Drinktober yet!
