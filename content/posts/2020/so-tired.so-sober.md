Sooooooo tired and I have no energy! Went to give blood Today and itâ€™s the first time itâ€™s not been a great excuse to get drunk quicker! Overall Iâ€™m feeling better not drinking but Iâ€™m struggling to stay awake tonight: I reckon one vodka would currently knock me out anyway so I guess Viva le Sober! 

Also on the subject of unconventional tattoos.... Iâ€™ve booked one with all the money I saved not drinking ðŸ˜‚
