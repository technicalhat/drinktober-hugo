I’m not even going to try to explain the [Padstow ‘Obby 'Oss festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Obby_%27Oss_festival). It’s just another Perfectly Normal thing that we do on Perfectly Normal Island,.

Think yourselves lucky nobody was doing an [Up Helly Aa](https://www.uphellyaa.org/) beer, otherwise everything would be on fire right now…
