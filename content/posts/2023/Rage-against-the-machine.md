Step on up, folks - it's time! Welcome to the greatest combat event of all time.

In the red corner, weighing in at 155kg kilos of titanium and bad attitude. The Future of Law Enforcement! The OCP Assassin! Half man! Half machine! All badass! Robocop!!!

And in the blue corner, weighing in at 120 kilos of booze and belligerence. He’s rough! He’s tough! He’s beginning to realise he’s very badly outmatched! The mighty Beerman!

And now, take your places and wait for the bell, as we begin the ultimate contest of Man vs Machine!
