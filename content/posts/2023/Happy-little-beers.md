Hello, I'm Beerb Ross. Welcome to todays episode the Art of Happiness. 

Why don't you just sit back and relax while I work on this little number here, or maybe grab your brushes and paint along?

We've got a bunch of nice little folks having a fun old time here down here at the pub, and I'm just gonna go ahead and add in some happy little beers here. Don't they look tasty?
