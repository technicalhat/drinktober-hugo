Today I had a late meeting again, so popped to the pub for the ultimate test. I was gaggingggggg for a drink. Any drink. Wine. Gin. Terps. I fancied one. 

The batman (I meant barman but autocorrect knows best)  recommended an _Alcohol Free_ Kopperberg. “It’s just like the real thing! You can’t even tell the difference!” I was assured. Not a cider drinker but I thought give it a bash. 

It was the worst thing I’ve ever had in my mouth. Allegedly strawberry and lime: it actually tastes just like cheap kids sweets. Which is fine, except I hate sweets in general especially the cheap kids variety. It tasted like a foam shrimp dissolved in roller cola, drank from a tramps shoe which had had some meths and benelyn spilled in it. 

0/10. Not impressed. Off to sulk with a quorn wrap. Thank you also to my friend Frankie for buying me a drink.
