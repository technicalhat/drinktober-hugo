I’ve realised that this site has become more my rambling blog than anything so I’ll keep it brief today! 90’s Carrie Bradshaw narration isn’t a good look for me.

Still alcohol free and I’ve developed a new love for good old water. Managed to stay off the quorn today and had a nice Sunday dinner feat. nut roast. I have however replaced my wine habit with a spending habit: I’ve bought a painting, another lamp, a hat, a magnetic eyelash set, a kaftan, a pigeon pin badge and a gift for the missus already this weekend (the last ones a secret.)  tatty-bye for now!
