Today is _slightly_ **better**! Purchased some iron tablets: turned out that’s what fucked me up yesterday. An iron tablet and a multivit and I’m off. 

I went out for work drinks this evening and had (drum roll please!) a J20 and a virgin cocktail.... Which was nice but called ‘the love island’ so minus 3 points. I also spent a hideous amount on experimental quorn and nutroasts in Lidl. I’m currently sipping cranberry juice out of a wine glass so I can express my inner Friday Heidi. In positive news, my persistent kidney infection has fucked off due to not surviving off Diet Coke, and in a month I’ll be on a beach. Happy weekend you absolute Walnuts.
