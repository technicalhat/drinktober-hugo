Habits are funny aren’t they! 5 days in and I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve thought “oh I’ll just grab a coke” or wandered aimlessly to the wine aisle and spent £15 before I’ve even thought about if I actually want it! 

Today was chilled with the wife and I’ve smashed in a decent homemade Quorn Lasagne. I now own 48% shares in Quorn FYI. My skin is also looking much brighter, although I do smash a load of acid on my face every night because 30’s, so it could also be that.
