So there we have it, folks. Another year of [#Drinktober](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/drinktober?epa=HASHTAG) comes to a close, and we absolutely smashed it this time around.

Donations are currently sitting at 110% of the fundraising target, Heidi's swanned off to Tenerife to drink her body weight in Prosecco, and it's time to sign off until we come back even bigger and better for Drinktober 2020!

Watch this space!
