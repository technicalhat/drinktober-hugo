I donâ€™t have anything exciting to say. Iâ€™ve just accepted drinking water is my life now.... made a vegan sausage casserole for tomorrow nights dinner and made very nice dumplings to chuck in. Of course housemate then reminds me that they have beef dripping in, so I canâ€™t have them.  Chuffing excellent. Fml.
