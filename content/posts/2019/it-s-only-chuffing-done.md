Well, itâ€™s done!! And what a bloody month. Hereâ€™s what I learned:

* I donâ€™t need alcohol, but I DO have the most stressful life and I donâ€™t take enough time out. The past 2 weeks at work were hard. Not having a drink made me realise my job can be emotionally draining. I have little time for myself and I take on too much without thinking about unwinding in a better way.
* Diet Coke: Iâ€™m over it. It tastes like overly fizzy dish water and Iâ€™ve cured my addiction.
* I like not eating meat. Iâ€™ve not missed it at all, and eating it again today made me throw up. Twice. I could happily live without meat now. And quorn is just ace.
* I didnâ€™t lose weight. I assumed losing alcohol and meat I would also lose some lbs: not happened! So maybe Iâ€™m naturally a bit fat due to middle age.
* I weirdly enjoyed writing the mini blog, which saw me steadily unravel. Although sometimes I was too knackered or busy to keep it up, Iâ€™d like to continue it! 


* The biggest thing I learned is the people around me are incredible. My friends really rallied around to be there for me, theyâ€™re good people. As someone a bit gay, Iâ€™m lucky enough to be able to choose my own family. Jonny and Vikki are also the epitome of good friendship: the people who I rarely see but who go above and beyond  to show they care. Not only did they donate and get me through: they made the most amazing website and made the whole experience not as much of a ballache as I expected. I am blessed to have met these little legends and to call them both my friends.
* Booze is expensive. In a month Iâ€™ve saved a few hundred quid and paid off all my credit cards!!

  .....on that note, Iâ€™m off on holiday. Donâ€™t bother robbing me house, my lodgers in and he has a temper.
* SEE YOU NEXT YEAR WHEN I REALLY GO TO TOWN!
