Day _counts on fingers_ 12, almost 13!! And I’m surprisingly ok, barring the odd “oh I could have a glass of....never mind” thoughts I’m alright! I’m tired, but less tired than usual. This is the first year I’ve not been tearing my hair out by week 2, I’m shocked how well I’m doing!? Someone have a party and tempt me to make it harder, I’m sick of grouting things!
