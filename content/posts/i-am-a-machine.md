Hola! Works been stressful and last night I struggled a lot to not drink.   
Butttttt, today I got weighed and Iâ€™ve lost 6lbs, taking my total to 16lbs which made me feel better! Went walking and managed 8.2 miles today, meaning I donâ€™t fancy a drink at all tonight! 

Please take a moment to donate if you can, my legs might drop off from todayâ€™s wandering so a cheeky fiver whilst Iâ€™m infirm would be ðŸ‘Œ
