The ultimate challenge has occurred: had a meeting in the pub tonight after work. But, I stayed strong; and had 2 diet cokes! Which weirdly are more expensive than a pint, but hey ho still cheaper than moet. 

I also resisted fish and chips, my only greater love than wine, so Iâ€™m chuffed I managed that despite being up at 6 with my dad been taken to a&e and work all day. Go me, peak adult! 

Tomorrow involves building work and plastering so that may be a challenge to not drink/cry because we all know how I cope with mess!
