For the 26th of [#Drinktober](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/drinktober?epa=HASHTAG), I finally opened this can of Pimms with blackberry and elderflower that's been lurking in the fridge for a couple of years now. I'm not entirely sure what Pimms is exactly, but this basically tastes like Ribena.
