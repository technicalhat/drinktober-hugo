Where the hell has October gone?! A week and a day to go until normality can resume. Today was manic and I didn’t atop, but I didn’t actually think about having a drink, even though I had a night to myself when I’d usually treat myself. That’s personal growth right there lads! 

We’ve not had many donations this year, despite Johnny making it the highest class DrinkTober yet. So thank you to those that have donated, and the rest of you get your hands in your pockets!
