A hearty welcome beer fans, I’m back! \


October has snuck up far too quickly once again and I am already missing a cheeky Savvy B. You might notice I am late to the sober party - in true Drinktober style I decided to jet off on a pre sobriety holiday and tit about in Croatia, I hope you all forgive me! \


Jonny is already having a whale of a time with his escapades so I’ve been debating how to make this year a bit harder. I thought about what I hate most in the world, which brought me to spiders and exercise. So in honour of Drinktober, I’m going to be attempting an exercise every day to see if it kills me. It might not be pretty, but it’s for a good cause! 1 in 2 of us will get the big C in our lifetime, so watch me suffer as we try to raise some awareness and a bit of cash whilst Johnny gets to enjoy a nice cold beer. \


Today’s exercise is sponsored by a glass of water and a walk around the block. Any ideas for terrible and humiliating exercises, drop them in the comment and don’t forget to leave a donation.
