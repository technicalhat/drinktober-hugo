Shiver me timbers! Legends tell of a lost pirate vessel, cursed to wander the high seas eternally with her terrifying skeleton crew, only appearing on the 28th of [#Drinktober](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/drinktober?source=feed_text&epa=HASHTAG) to plunder the booty of the living.

Beware the Ghost Ship, me hearties, lest she take ye to Davy Jones' locker!
