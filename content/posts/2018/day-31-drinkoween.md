It's the 31st of [#Drinktober](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/drinktober?source=feed_text&epa=HASHTAG) - [#Drinkoween](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/drinkoween?source=feed_text&epa=HASHTAG)!

So there was really no other option than to assemble a bunch of my spookiest stuff and finish off the month with the "Unofficial Beer Of Halloween" - Hobgoblin!
