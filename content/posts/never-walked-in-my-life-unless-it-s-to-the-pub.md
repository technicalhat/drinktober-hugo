I am back! Didn’t post yesterday because I managed to lock myself out of the website: something that’s a common occurrence when drunk but I’m not sure how I managed it sober. 

10 whole days in and I’ve lost 10lbs which is rather nice. Can’t say I’ve saved money because my house is falling down but still, I’ll take it! Today as oppose to my usual leisurely walk to the pub (the extent of my normal walking) I went on an actual solo wander which ended up being quite a treck through a housing estate, a tiny forest, some nice hills and some ropey garages. Feeling fairly good!
